NOTE:  Due to my ethical, security and leadership concerns about Microsoft, OpenAI, and Copilot I am migrating OFF GitHub to GitLab.  You can find me here:  [https://gitlab.com/noahgift](https://gitlab.com/noahgift)

What currently keeps me busy is working as the founder of [âœ¨Pragmatic AI Labs which builds courses on edX](https://insight.paiml.com/d69) and as an [Executive in Residence at the Duke MIDS (Data Science)](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/noahgift) and Duke AI Product Management program and as a consultant and author in Cloud Computing, Big Data, DevOps, and MLOps. The following visual resume is a good idea to show the kinds of things I have worked on in my life.  I am a Rust Fanatic.

âš¡ Fun facts: I was as a bouncer in college with former UFC Champion Chuck Liddell.  Early in my career I worked on the [movie Avatar while living in New Zealand](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2104112/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).  I used to play basketball with Adam Sandler at lunch when I worked at Sony Imageworks in Los Angeles, CA.
